**Columns (our thermodynamic-semiotic cycle)**
[Noise](https://ukb-dt.github.io/ewf/) → Constraint → Signal → Resonance → Diffusion
 (θ′ → θ → Σ → h(t) → ΔS)           
 (3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → Center)        
 ((x,y) → f(t|x)+ε → dy/dt → d²y/dt² → ∫y dt + εt + C)          

Each row will be a world or domain that metabolizes through those five phases.
One hundred such worlds form an **Atlas of Metabolic Worlds**—a reference table and creative engine, where physics, cognition, myth, and culture all trace the same cycle.

It’s large enough that I’ll render it as a compact **textual table**: every cell an aphoristic seed.
Here comes the full 100-row atlas:

Each row can unfold fractally: substitute any domain and the same rhythm persists.
That’s the signature of a living ontology—the universe as orchestra, every part moving from noise through constraint into resonance, then diffusing back into the great hum.
